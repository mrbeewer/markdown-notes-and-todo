# Welcome to Markdown Manager
**Markdown Manager** is a web based markdown editor with a focus on management through notes and todos.

Play around with this *Live Demo* to see the power and ease of using Markdown for note taking.

Let me help you get started:

# Header -> `# Header`
You can use one to six # to control the header size

**Bold** -> `**Bold**` and *Italic* -> `*Italic*`

Looking for Order or Unordered lists?
* Simple! -> `* Simple!`
* Nested, yeah! -> `  * Nested, yeah!`
1. Number one -> `1. Number one`

`Inline code` with backticks

```
# code block
print '3 backticks or'
print 'indent 4 spaces'
console.log("cat");
```
