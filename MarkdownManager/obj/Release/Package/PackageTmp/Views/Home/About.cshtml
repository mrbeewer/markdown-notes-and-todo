<h3>Approach:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Planning Phase
        <ul>
            <li>With more time available on this project, more time was spent on the planning phase.</li>
            <li>Used Trello for basic SCRUM management as well as keeping track of resources and things that needed to be researched further.</li>
            <li>Used Draw.io to put together Use Case Diagrams, UML Diagrams, User Stories, and Wireframing.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Project Outline
        <ul>
            <li>MVP - Web application where a user can login / register, use Markdown make documents (with code snippets) and create / manage a ToDo list.</li>
            <li>
                After logging into the system, the user will be able to use Markdown syntax to make documents as they see fit. This project initially is<br />
                geared towards notes / project management for a programmer / developer. As such, code blocks and syntax highlighting is important.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to keep the user within the app and to facilitate task management, the user will be able to easily add and view ToDo tasks.<br />
                These tasks will also have an option for tagging for increased organization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Planned Technologies:
                <ul>
                    <li>ASP.NET for server side</li>
                    <li>SQL for database (unsure at the moment)</li>
                    <li>HTML / CSS / JavaScript for client side</li>
                    <li>
                        <em>
                            Will take advantage of available Markdown converters and syntax highlighting as the intention of this project is not to develope those<br />
                            from scratch but show the ability to incorporate previously developed technology.
                        </em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Development Phase
        <ul>
            <li>
                With ASP.NET / C# being a new environment and language for this project, three to four days were spend purely working through tutorials and<br />
                reading through digital resources to get up to speed.
            </li>
            <li>
                With enough knowledge to be dangerous, I transitioned to getting a base app together to build from using these basics. As I continue to<br />
                enhance the app, more resources will be collected to answer the more specific questions that arise.
            </li>
            <li>Before working together the models and controllers, focus was turned to defining a preliminary database structure to achieve the desired result.</li>
            <li>
                ToDo Module: Due to simplicity and similarity to available tutorials / guides, the ToDo portion was tackled first. Configuring the relational<br />
                piece of the tables proved to difficult, with out-dated tutorials and inconsistent information. Once the ToDo items were tied to their user, some<br />
                bonus features such as pagination, filtering, sorting were added.
            </li>
            <li>
                Notes Module: Creating the Notes Module was largely an exercise in replicating the CRUD of ToDo and adding the Markdown Conversion functionality.<br />
                Although the Markdown conversion works well, it took time to fully integrate and adjust overlapping CSS for an appropriate appearance.<br />
                Another learned lesson on this portion was dealing with data validation. As the converter will allow HTML tags, the validation routine was catching<br />
                the tags and reporting unsafe conditions (and potential of allowing hack-scripts). In this case, the tags are desired and after a lot of investigation,<br />
                adding <code>[AllowHtml]</code> to the Document Model provided correct validation. Although there are methods to counter the validation through the controller,<br />
                that could introduce security holes into the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                As I always focus on functionality programming, little has been done on the overall look of the page. Thankfully the default project with Visual<br />
                Studio uses Bootstrap and a minimal appearance that I can build from.
            </li>
